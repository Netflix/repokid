    Update data about all roles in a given account:
      1) list all the roles and initiate a role object with basic data including name and roleID
      2) get inline policies for each of the roles
      3) build a list of active roles - we'll want to keep data about roles that may have been deleted in case we
         need to restore them, so if we used to have a role and now we don't see it we'll mark it inactive
      4) update data about the roles in Dynamo
      5) mark inactive roles in Dynamo
      6) load and instantiate filter plugins
      7) for each filter determine the list of roles that it filters
      8) update data in Dynamo about filters
      9) get Aardvark data for each role
      10) update Dynamo with Aardvark data
      11) calculate repoable permissions/policies for all the roles
      12) update Dynamo with information about how many total and repoable permissions and which services are repoable
      13) update stats in Dynamo with basic information like total permissions and which filters are applicable
